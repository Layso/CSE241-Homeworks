# CSE241-Homeworks
This repository will contain all homeworks of the Gebze Institute of Technology, CSE 241 lecture, Fall 2016. Besides the source code homeworks now contains a makefile and several screenshots of the working program. There is no more a code convention to follow, coding design is personal and may have changes over time.

-Homework #01
-
In this homework main.cpp works (actually simulates) as a CPU which has 5 registers and takes instructions to work on them. Takes an input .txt file which contains another program written in homework specialized assembly language and processes that text file. There are 7 instructions, which are MOV-ADD-SUB-MOV-PRN-JMP-HLT, available. Instruction definitions can be found in homework definition PDF or inside the source code.

-Homework #02
-
This homework is continued version of homework 1. There are some small additions. CPU now has one more instruction which is JPN. Similar to JMP but controls if one number is smaller or equals to 0. Which provides a compare operation between numbers. Also there is now a memory which has 50 cells inside it and ready to used by CPU. Homeworks also wants a CPU Program that takes 10 numbers (random numbers given on PDF inserted to memory) and sorts them.
